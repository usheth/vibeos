Minimal x86_64 Unix-like OS for learning OS development, systems programming, and agent workflows.

## Goals
- Build a tiny, understandable boot-to-kernel path.
- Implement a minimal Unix-like kernel (processes, files, syscalls).
- Learn toolchains, low-level debugging, and systems design.

## Status
Empty scaffold. First milestone: boot a 64-bit kernel that prints a message.

## Next
See `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/LEARNING.md`.
