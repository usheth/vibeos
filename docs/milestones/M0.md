# M0: Toolchain + Build Skeleton

## Goal
Establish a working toolchain and a minimal build/run/test skeleton.

## Accomplished
- Built and verified the `x86_64-elf` cross-compiler toolchain.
- Added a minimal kernel entry in `kernel/entry.S` with a Multiboot2 header and a safe halt loop.
- Added a linker script in `kernel/linker.ld` that places the kernel at 1 MiB.
- Added a GRUB2 config in `boot/grub.cfg`.
- Added a simple `Makefile` with `kernel`, `iso`, `run`, and `clean` targets.
- Added a build test `tests/test_build.sh` and verified it passes.
- Verified ISO creation with `grub-mkrescue` and headless QEMU boot (no output yet, by design).

## Key Takeaways
- The linker script controls *where* the kernel lives in memory.
- The Multiboot2 header is how GRUB recognizes the kernel.
- Headless QEMU with serial output is sufficient for early OS bring-up.

## Evidence
- `tests/test_toolchain.sh` passes.
- `tests/test_build.sh` passes.
- `make iso` succeeds.
- `make run` boots headless (no output yet because the kernel only halts).

## Next (M1)
- Switch to 64-bit long mode.
- Print a message to serial so we can see the kernel running.
