# M1: 32-bit Serial Print

## Goal
Print a message from the kernel in 32-bit protected mode using serial output.

## Accomplished
- Added a minimal serial driver in `kernel/serial.c` using COM1 (`0x3F8`).
- Added `kernel/kmain.c` to initialize serial and print a hello string.
- Updated `kernel/entry.S` to call `kmain` after stack setup.
- Updated the build pipeline to compile C code and link with the entry object.
- Added `tests/test_run_serial.sh` to validate serial output via QEMU.

## Key Takeaways
- Early serial output is the simplest way to observe kernel behavior in headless QEMU.
- Calling into C from the assembly entry point keeps the boot stub small and readable.
- The linker layout still controls where C code and string literals live in memory.

## Evidence
- `tests/test_build.sh` passes with C objects linked into `kernel.elf`.
- `tests/test_run_serial.sh` finds the hello string in the serial log.
